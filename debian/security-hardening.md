# Security Hardening

Hardening a system is an important process to carry-out for all newly provisioned systems, and existing in-production systems, to insure that information is secured and services can be provided in a continuous and reliable manner.

This configuration guide walks through the process of securing a standard Debian installation by installing various security tools, instituting "best practice" changes to the default settings of pre-installed services, and insuring the latest protocols are utilized. This guide, however, does not guarantee that a system is impervious to a security breach, nor does it account for the human factor in system security. Rather, it simply takes a "best effort" at implementing the best standard of security on a system while leaving the maintenance of security to institutional policies.

## Server Security

Each server can be configured to further enhance the security of that system. Configuration changes are typically related to kernel options which can prevent certain activities from occurring on the server, to system properties such as the default permissions on files, folders, and executables.

### Restricting Task Scheduling

Linux systems include four mechanisms for users to schedule one-time and regular tasks. Such tasks, when used maliciously, could be used to maintain open backdoors, exhaust system resources, etc. Therefore, restricting who's authorized to use the scheduling system could prevent malicious use by un-authorized, or compromised users.

Here's a list of those task scheduling systems:
* at: Runs a task once, at a specific time in the future.
* batch: Runs a particular task when the system load drops below a specified value.
* cron: Runs tasks at specific times according to a schedule.
* anacron: Periodically runs specified tasks when the system is available.

The `atd` service manages both `at` and `batch`. The `cron` and `anacron` task scheduling systems each use a separate service.

### at and batch Restriction

To restrict user access to the `at` and `batch` scheduling systems, create a file called `/etc/at.allow`. If this file exists, `at` and `batch` will limit access to only those users listed in the file.

Create the `at.allow` file:

```bash
sudo touch /etc/at.allow
```

Edit `/etc/at.allow` and add the root user:

```bash
root
```

If a `/etc/at.deny` file exists it provides the reverse of `at.allow`. It enables all users to access `at`, except those whose usernames are listed in `at.deny`.


### cron Restriction

To restrict user access to the `cron` scheduling system, create a file called `/etc/cron.allow`. If this file exists, `cron` will limit access to only those users listed in the file.

Create the `cron.allow` file:

```bash
sudo touch /etc/cron.allow
```

Edit `/etc/cron.allow` and add the root user:

```bash
root
```

If a `/etc/cron.deny` file exists it provides the reverse of cron.allow. It enables all users to access cron, except those whose usernames are listed in `cron.deny`.

### Mount Protection

Each partition on a Linux system can be mounted to a directory relative to the root directory. When mounting a partition, the principle of lease privileges should be followed by restricting the permissions and activities that can be carried out on the mounted partition. This is achieved by mounting each partition with the most restrictive mount options available without impacting required functionality.

#### Mount Options

* nodev: Do not interpret character or block special devices on the file system.
* nosuid: Do not allow set-user-identifier or set-group-identifier bits to take effect.
* noexec: Do not allow direct execution of any binaries on the mounted filesystem.

#### Recommended Setup

Below is a table of partitions (which would have been setup following our installation guide), and which mount options should be enabled for those mounted file systems.

| Partition | nodev | nosuid | noexec |
| --------- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| /boot     | Yes   | Yes    | Yes    |
| /home     | Yes   | Yes    | Yes (Only if code will not be executed out of the home directories.) |
| /tmp      | Yes   | Yes    | Yes (Only if packages will not be build from scratch on this system.) |
| /usr      | No    | No     | No     |
| /var      | No    | No     | No     |
| /var/tmp  | Yes   | Yes    | Yes    |

#### Application

Edit the mount configuration file, `/etc/fstab`, and apply the appropriate permission mentioned in the _Recommended Setup_ section by appending the permissions to the `<options>` column for each mounted partition:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

## Account Security

Account security involves the creation and management of user accounts on a system in a manner that ensures the security and integrity of that system. Account security has two aspects that must be handled; first, protecting the access to accounts on a system, and second, ensuring that an account is used in a manner that is appropriate given institutional policies.

### SSH Auto-Logout

The OpenSSH daemon allows administrators to set an idle timeout interval. After this interval has passed, any idle users will be automatically logged out, and their SSH connection terminated.

Edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` configuration file and add the following at the bottom of the file:

```
ClientAliveInterval 1800
ClientAliveCountMax 0
```

### User Home Folder Access

Debian-based systems create world-readable home directories by default when creating accounts using `adduser`. This allows users on a shared system to access the files and folders inside of each otherâ€™s home directories. Access includes the ability to execute programs within the directories of other users, along with reading the contents of any file. This is a potential security vulnerability, giving users access to material they shouldn't. Therefore, we must change this default.

Execute the following command to re-configure the `adduser` program:

```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure adduser
```

An interactive configuration screen will appear to configure the `adduser` settings.

Select _No_ for system-wide readable home directories.

Next, we must secure all home directories that already exist on the system, removing world privileges, by executing the following command, replacing `[USERNAME]` with the name of the user's home directory:

```bash
sudo chmod -R o-rwx /home/[USERNAME]
```

Modify `/etc/adduser.conf`, and change the following property:

```
DIR_MODE=0751
```

> `DIR_MODE` originally has the value of `0755`, but that value is changed to `0751` by our call to `dpkg-reconfigure`.

To the following value:

```
DIR_MODE=0750
```

Changing the default permissions from `751` to `750` disables the default permission that allows executables within a user's home directory to be executed by other users.

## Default Permissions

Files and directories are typically created on a Unix system with world readable permissions. That means any user on that system, besides the file's owner, can, by default, read the contents of newly created files, even if that user is not the owner, or part of the group assigned to the file.

To mitigate the availability of file contents to third-parties, we change the `UMASK` used by our Linux system when setting the default permissions on new files and directories.

Edit `/etc/login.defs` and change the following line:

```
UMASK 022
```

To the following value:

```
UMASK	027
```

Next edit the PAM configuration file, `/etc/pam.d/common-session`, and add the `pam_umask` module as an optional module:

```
session optional pam_umask.so
```

Though `pam_umask` is listed as optional, if it's available on the system it will be loaded by PAM.

> The `pam_umask.so` module is provided by the `libpam-modules` Debian package.

## Update Host SSH Keys

The host keys for the server need to be updated to use a larger key size for better cryptographic security.

Temporarily log into the root account using `sudo`:

```bash
sudo su
```

Run the following two commands to generate new SSH keys for the host system:

```bash
yes | ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 16384 -N '' -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
yes | ssh-keygen -t dsa -b 1024 -N '' -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
```

**Note:** We call `yes` here to auto answer prompts affirmatively so that the process can be automated.

**Note:** DSA keys can only be as large as 1024 bits in length. This is a restriction imposed by FIPS 186-2 and enforced by OpenSSL (The manager of SSH keys).
