# Hyper-Expanse Configuration

_Hyper-Expanse Configuration_ is a collection of guides for setting up a personal network with services and tools that meet my needs for doing software development. All content on this site is stored in a [publicly hosted git repository](https://gitlab.com/hyper-expanse/configuration), and has been meticulously refined through repeatedly setting up my own systems following these guides. It should be noted, though, that these guides are not comprehensive. You are strongly encouraged to invest additional effort into topics, such as security, to ensure the best possible experience given your own circumstances.

There are three primary chapters: Setting up a Debian system, setting up a Windows system, and lastly, a collection of tips for improving the user experience on Linux and Windows.
